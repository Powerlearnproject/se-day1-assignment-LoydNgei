Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  - Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing and maintaining and maintainig software applications.
  IMPORTANCE IN TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY
  1. Real World problems get solved through software engineering
  2. Scalability. In a world where there is growing data and systems, software engineering ensures that the systems scale effectively
  3. Usability and accessibility. By creating end to end User Interfaces People are able to consume softwares built
  
  

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  1. 1950s - Development of high-level programming languanges
  2. 1970s - introduction of Personal computers
  3. 1990s - Emergence of the Internet
  4. 2000s - Mobile App development emergences
  5. Current - Rise of Cloud computing and AI

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  SDLC - Is a process of software building that is followed within a Software organization
  1. Planning and designing requirements - The quality of the end product is determined here. Information gathered in this stage creates the building blocks of the project
  2. Defining requirements - All requirements for the software are specified in this stage
  3. Designing architecture - The best Design that complies is determined
  4. Product development - At this stage software engineers develop using a specific programming tool(Language) that aligns with the design rules
  5. Product testing and integration - After development testing is key to ensure smooth execution
  6. Deployment and maintenance - After testing, the finished product is released in phases as per the organizations strategy.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

  Waterfall methodology is a methodology known for it's structured progression where each project phase must be completed before proceeding to the next
  Agile methodology is best known for it's flexibility and adaptability. This methodology operates on iterative progress through small, manageable units of work

  Scenario to use Agile methodology: When doing software development for a customer where his/her requirements keep on changing rapidly
  Scenario to use waterfall methodology: Supply chain management development where each stage from procurement to production to distrubution follows a set order

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

  Software developer
    1. Collaborating with other team members in the development process (e.g The UX experts)
    2. Designing the architecture of the product to be developed
    3. Building the product in collaboration with other developers
    
  Quality Assurance Engineer
    1. Thorough testing of the developed product

  Project Manager
    1. Overseeing the research and market surveys before the SDLC cycle begins
    2. Planning the whole process of building and allocating roles
    3. Receiving feedback from the customer on new requirements
    4. Giving feedback on the progress of the development
    
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  IDEs and VCs serve as tools that help streamline developers work. 
  IDEs are code editors that are used to write code on and with additional features that make the work even easier. A good example of an IDE is VSCode that is popular among    developers
  VCs are systems that developers rely on for collaborating and ensuring continous development without conflicts in the way they are working. A good example is Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  1. Rapid technology changes. To overcome this is by trying to keep up with the trends and being adaptive in technology industry
  2. Communication barries between them and clients. this can be overcomed by ensuring they practice active listening and breakdown technical concepts to clients
  3. Security concerns while building. To overcome this a software engineer needs to be continous learning on strategies to secure their software while building

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  1. Unit testing - Testing individual components (Functions and methods) in isolation to help catch bugs early
  2. Integration testing - Ensures multiple modules/components work together correctly
  3. System testing - Tests an entire application as a whole to verify it meets requirements to ensure overrall functionality
  4. Acceptance testing - Confirms the software meets business needs and user expectation

  IMPORTANCE: Ensure reliability, help catch defects earlier, reduces costs, and improves user experiences
  

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
  Is the practice of designing clear, precise inputs to optimize AI responses
  IMPORTANCE: Helps to get relevant, accurate and useful outputs from AI models

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

  Vague prompt: "Tell me about software engineering"
  improved prompt: "Explain Software engineering in simple terms, focusing in it's usefulness in the finance industry"
